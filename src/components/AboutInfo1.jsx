                 Once we get a help request via our official WhatsApp no (+91 91122 66995) or online form 
                (https://india.foodbank.co/help), our volunteers assess the urgency of the need. 
                If possible we try to resolve the case at the level of ration card by taking help from the 
                respective state's/district's govt websites or any officials we are directly in touch with. 
                Making people aware of their rights and entitlement under the PDS scheme and assisting them
                 in understanding the process of applying, renewing, adding more members in their ration card, 
                 wherever applicable, is a part of this process to get people in the system for the long term 
                 benefit.
